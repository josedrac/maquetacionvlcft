            <h2>The History of Valencia Through Food</h2>
            <p><strong>I am on a mission to bring the real Valencia to travelers.</strong> On my food tours you will not find franchises, chain restaurants, mediocre places or tourist traps. Join me to learn about Valencia’s <strong>legendary establishments that have been open for decades</strong> (some – over a century!). Meet the owners who inherited business from their parents and proudly keep local traditions alive to this day. Taste the <strong>authentic food made from the best ingredients</strong>. Explore the special off-the-beaten-track neighborhoods and <strong>eat traditional Valencia food</strong> where locals do!</p>
            <p><strong>Become a Valencian for a few hours… Join us!</strong></p>
